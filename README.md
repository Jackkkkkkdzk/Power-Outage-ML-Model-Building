# Power-Outage-Prediction-Model

# Framing the Problem
When power outage happens, what citizens care most about is how long the outage is going to last, when will their life be back to normal. When they can expect the duration of outage, they can make best use of the time without power instead of waiting anxiously. This make the prediction of power outage duration a very meaningful task. We are trying to build a machine learning model that best predict the duration of power outage.

- Prediction Problem: How long will a power outage last?
- Type: Regression
- Reponse variable: OUTAGE.DURATION
- Metric: $R^2$ R<sup>2</sup> R^2^

The reason we choose OUTAGE.DURATION as the response variable it corresponds to out prediction problem.
The reason we choose R
